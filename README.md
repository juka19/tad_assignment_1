Assignment 1


Repo for the submission of the text as data assignment 1. 
My code is organized in 4 scripts in the src folder of the repo. The first one (1_scrape) scrapes the poems data from the provided web address. The second script (2_visualization) deals with the analysis of that data, creating the histograms, frequency plots and the document feature matrices. The third script (3_parseXML) parses the data from the XML Bundestag session, the fourth script (4_speeches_and_regex) implement the analysis tasks related to that data.
